1. Describe possible performance optimizations for your Code.
    The code itself is very simple, but some optimizations that it could be made are:
        - In the frontend, implement redux to help scaling the app, right now since is very simple 
        it works with the components state, but implement redux would help to make the app more scalable
        - Implement helpers to save line of code in the Laravel backend

2. Which things could be done better, than youâ€™ve done it?
    Maybe the way that is implement the frontend it could be better, separate the components better, usign
    redux to have a global state.
    Also in the backend using other helpers of Laravel for example in the function to store data, I had
    to write every column of the table, Laravel has helpers that help you to save time and line of codes
    for this kind of operations.
